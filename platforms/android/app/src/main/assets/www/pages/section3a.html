      <p><b>If the baby is not crying after drying, you will need to help the baby breathe in The Golden Minute.</b></p>
	  <p><b>Keep warm</b><br>
	  Keep the baby skin-to-skin on the mother’s chest/abdomen. If that is not possible, place the baby on a warm, dry blanket beside the mother. Ask your helper to cover the head.</p>
	  <p><b>Clear the airway if needed</b><br>Position the head. Position the neck slightly extended to keep the airway open. The nose will be as far forward as possible. If the neck is flexed or extended too far, air may not enter freely. If secretions are not seen and there is no meconium, move directly to stimulate breathing.</p>
	<p><b>Remove secretions from the airway</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>if they are blocking the mouth or nose</b></li>
		OR
		<li><b>if there is meconium in the amniotic fluid</b></li>
		Remove secretions by
		<li>Wiping – use a cloth to gently clear mouth and then nose to remove the largest amount of secretions first.</li>
		OR
		<li>Bulb suction – squeeze the bulb before inserting the tip into the mouth and release before withdrawing. Then clear the nose.</li>
		OR
		<li>Suction tube – insert the tube into the side of the baby’s mouth no more than
		5 cm. Apply suction for 2-3 seconds while withdrawing the tube. Insert the tube
		1 to 2 cm into the nostril and apply suction while withdrawing.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<p><b>Stop suctioning when secretions are cleared, even if the baby does not breathe. Suctioning too long, too vigorously, too deeply, or too often can cause injury,
slow heart rate, and prevent breathing.</b></p>
<p><b>Stimulate breathing</b><br>
Rub the back 2 or 3 times gently but firmly. Do not delay or stimulate longer.
Move quickly to evaluate breathing and ventilate if needed. Drying, clearing the airway, and stimulating breathing should take less than one minute. Your actions in The Golden Minute can help many babies begin to breathe.</p>
