      <p><b>About 1 in 10 babies needs help to breathe. Rapid assessment after drying at birth is the best way toknow if a baby needs help to breathe.</b></p>
      <p><b>Ask this question immediately after drying: </b><b style="color:#2184e0;">Is the baby crying?</b></p>
	  <p><b>Decide what care the baby needs</b><br>
	  The baby who is crying needs routine care. Most babies cry at birth. Crying means a baby is breathing well. Crying is possible when large amounts of air move in and out of the lungs. The crying baby usually moves his or her arms and legs and has good muscle tone. After crying for some time, a baby may stop crying and begin to breathe quietly and regularly.</p>
	  <p>A baby who does not cry needs help to breathe. Babies who do not cry may not be breathing at birth. A baby who is not breathing is limp and does not move.<br>The skin may be pale or bluish.<p>
	  <p>A baby who is breathing shallowly, gasping, or not breathing at all needs immediate help to breathe.</p>
	  <p>Quick action will help a baby start breathing sooner. If no help is given to a baby who is not breathing, that baby may die or experience serious brain damage.</p>
