      <p><b>The baby who is crying can receive routine care.</b></p>
	  <p><b>Keep warm</b><br>
	  Position the baby skin-to-skin with the mother. The warmth from the mother’s body is one of the best ways to keep a baby warm. Cover the baby with a warm, dry cloth and a cap or other head covering. Otherwise, cover the baby with part of the mother’s clothing. Skin-to-skin contact helps a newborn baby breathe well and initiate breastfeeding. Postpone bathing and weighing and keep the area warm.</p>
	  <p>Drying can be done on the mother’s abdomen. Place a clean cloth on mother’s abdomen before birth. Position the baby on the cloth and dry thoroughly. Remove the wet cloth, place the baby skin-to-skin with the mother, and cover with a dry cloth.</p>
	  <p><b>Check breathing</b><br>to assess the baby’s breathing. Listen to the sounds of breathing and look at or feel the movement of the chest.
Check that the baby is breathing quietly and easily or crying. Make sure that the neck
is slightly extended and air can pass freely through the baby’s nose. Be sure that mother and baby are not alone during the first
hours after birth.
