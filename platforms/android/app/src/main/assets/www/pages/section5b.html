<h3 align="left" style="color:#2184e0;">Disinfecting and testing equipment after every use *</h3>
<h4 align="left" style="color:#2184e0;">To disinfect</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wipe (immediate pre-cleaning):</b> While wearing gloves, wipe the
outside of the ventilation bag and mask with a gauze soaked in 0.5%
chlorine solution. Also wipe the outside of a bulb suction device.
If the suction device cannot be opened for cleaning inside, discard
it after use.</li>
<li><b>Disassemble:</b> Take apart the devices completely.</li>
<li><b>Clean:</b> Wash in warm soapy water to remove visible blood,
secretions, and other contaminated matter.</li>
<li><b>Sterilize or high-level disinfect:</b> Sterilize all parts by autoclaving
or high-level disinfect parts by boiling or steaming for 20 minutes or
submersion in an appropriate chemical disinfectant. Rinse in boiled
water after chemical disinfection.</li>
<li><b>Dry:</b> Allow all parts to dry completely before reassembly.</li>
<li><b>Reassemble:</b> Inspect all pieces for cleanliness and damage. Put
together the pieces of the ventilation bag and mask and suction
device.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4 align="left" style="color:#2184e0;">To test</h4>
<p>
<b>Ventilation bag and mask</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Put the mask on the ventilation
bag. Squeeze the bag and
look for the valve in the patient
outlet to open as you squeeze.
This shows the device is ready
to deliver air to a patient.<br><img src="img/section5b1.svg">
</li>
<li>Seal the mask tightly to the palm of your
hand and squeeze hard enough to open
the pressure release valve. Listen for the
sound of air escaping. This shows that air
which cannot be delivered safely to the
baby will escape through the pressure
release valve.<br><img src="img/section5b2.svg">
</li>
<li>
Maintain the tight seal and check
that the bag re-inflates after each
squeeze. This shows that fresh
air will enter the bag through
the inlet valve.<br><img src="img/section5b3.svg">
</li>
</ul>
<b>Suction device</b>
<ul><li>
Squeeze the bottom portion of
the suction device and hold the squeeze. Block the opening of
the tip against the palm of your hand and release the squeeze.
The suction device should not expand until the tip is unblocked.</li></ul>
</p>
<h4 align="left" style="color:#2184e0;">To ensure equipment is ready for use at all times	</h4>  
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Repair or replace any equipment that is damaged or does not
function.</b>Correct a problem when it occurs.
</li>
<li><b>Store clean equipment in a protected, safe place where it can be
accessed easily.</b> Store in a closed metal or plastic container that has
been high-level disinfected. Keep all equipment together where it
will be used.
</li>
<li><b>Dispose of contaminated supplies and handle contaminated
linen properly.</b> Restock with clean supplies and linen.</li>
