	<p><b>Ventilation with bag and mask is the most important and effective way to help the baby who is not breathing or is gasping. Ventilation opens the lungs with air.</b></p>
	<p><b>Begin to ventilate<br>
Follow your facility’s routine for when to <br>clamp or tie and cut the cord</b><br>
Cutting the cord should not delay the start of ventilation. Begin ventilation by 1 minute.
</p>
<p><b>Place the baby on the area for ventilation</b> <br>Use an area beside the mother if the cord is left intact. A skilled helper can clamp or tie and cut the cord if the baby is moved to a separate area.</p>
<p><b>Stand at the baby’s head</b><br>
You will need to control the position of the head and look for movement of the chest.</p>
<p><b>Check that the mask size is correct</b><br>The mask should cover the chin, mouth,  and nose, but not the eyes. The mask should make a tight seal on the face so air will enter the baby’s lungs.</p>
<p>A mask that is too large will not seal well on the face. Air will escape under the mask.
A mask that is too small will not cover both the mouth and nose and may block the nose. Air will not enter the lungs freely.</p>
