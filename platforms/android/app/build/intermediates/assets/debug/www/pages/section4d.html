<p><b>A baby who responded toventilation needs continued monitoring of breathing, heart rate, color, and temperature. Assess the baby for abnormal breathing or other danger signs that require advanced care.</b></p>
<p><b>Provide ongoing care</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Prolong skin-to-skin care</li>
<li>Continue with immediate essential newborn care to assess, maintain temperature, provide nutrition, and prevent infection</li>
<li>Make a note of care provided in the clinical record (see page 49)</li></ul></p>
<p><b>If referral is needed, transport mother and baby together</b><br>
Every facility should have guidelines for consultation or referral of babies who need help with breathing, feeding or temperature. Monitor the baby frequently before and during transport. Communicate the actions you have taken and your assessment to the responsible person at the receiving facility. Try to keep mother and baby together during transfer, even if only one is ill. Skin-to-skin care during transport facilitates observation and keeps the
baby warm. Consider if alternative methods of feeding are needed.</p>
<p><b>Support the family.</b><br>
If a baby needed help to breathe, explain what happened and what care will be given. Answer the family’s questions or find help to answer them. The mother may need help to express breast milk. If a baby is ill
or dies, respond in a culturally appropriate way. Respect the family’s wishes, privacy, and religious beliefs. Give the mother advice on breast care and family planning.</p>
<p><b>Prepare for the next time a baby needs help to breathe.</b>
Review the actions taken with other team members. Disinfect the ventilation bag, mask, and suction device. Store the
equipment in a place where it will stay clean and available for use (see page 46).</p>
