	<p><b>Position the head slightly extended</b><br>Keep the baby’s airway open by positioning the head slightly extended and supporting the chin.</p>
	<p><b>Apply the mask to the face</b><br>Position the rim of the mask to rest on the tip of the chin, then place the mask over mouth and nose.</p>
<p><b>Make a tight seal between the mask and the face</b> <br>Hold the mask on the face with the thumb and index finger on top of the mask. Use the middle finger to hold the chin up toward
the mask. Use the 4th and 5th fingers along the jaw to lift it forward and help keep the airway open.
</p>
<p>Make a tight seal by pressing lightly on the top of the mask and gently holding the chin up toward the mask. If the seal is not tight, air will not move into the lungs as you squeeze the bag. The air will escape under the rim of the mask. Do not push the mask down onto the face. This may change the head position and interfere with air entering the lungs.</p>
<p><b>Squeeze the bag to produce a gentle movement of the chest</b><br>The chest should move as if the baby were taking an easy breath. Make sure there is no leak between the mask and the baby’s
face. Squeeze the bag smoothly between your thumb and 2 fingers. Squeeze the bag harder if you need to deliver more air with each breath.
</p>
<p><b>Give 40 ventilation breaths per minute </b><br>Count aloud,“1…2…3…1…2…3”. If you squeeze the bag as you say,“1” and release while you say,“2…3,”you will ventilate at a rate that helps air move into and out of the lungs well.</p>
