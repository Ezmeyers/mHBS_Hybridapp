	<p><b>Evaluate the baby during ventilation by asking: </b><b style="color:#2184e0;">Is the chest moving with ventilation or is the baby breathing well? </b><b>Effective ventilation should produce a gentle movement of the chest.</b></p>
	<p><b>If the chest is not moving immediately</b><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Reapply the mask to make a better seal and at the same time</li>
	<li>Reposition the head to open the airway</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Keep ventilating with good chest movement until the baby begins to breathe.
Some babies improve quickly and begin breathing well after brief ventilation.
</p>
<p><b>A baby who is breathing well may be</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Crying</li>OR
<li>Breathing quietly and regularly</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>A baby who is not breathing well may be </b><br>
<ul>
<li>Gasping or breathing abnormally</li>OR
<li>Not breathing at all</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b> 
Decide what care the baby needs after beginning ventilation</b><br>
Stop ventilation when the baby is breathing well. The baby can remain with the mother under close monitoring. Count the breathing rate, listen for grunting, and look for chest indrawing. A baby who is gasping or not breathing at all needs continued ventilation with bag and mask. A baby who is breathing abnormally needs close monitoring and may need more help to breathe.
