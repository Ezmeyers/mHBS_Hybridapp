	<p><b>If a baby does not begin to breathe after 1 minute of ventilation with chest movement, evaluate heart rate to decide if ventilation is adequate.</b></p>
<p><b>Ask the question:</b><br>
<b style="color:#2184e0;">Is the heart rate normal or slow?</b></p>
<p>Continue ventilation for 1 minute before stopping to check the heart rate. A skilled helper can count the umbilical cord pulsations during the first minute without interrupting ventilation.  If you have no skilled helper or the cord pulse cannot be felt, you will need to rely on movement of the chest as an indicator of adequate ventilation.</p>
<p><b>Decide if the heart rate is normal or slow</b><br>
A baby’s heart rate should be faster than your heart rate. Evaluate the heart rate by listening to the heartbeat with a stethoscope or feeling the umbilical cord
pulse. Listen over the left chest and pause ventilation for several seconds in order to hear the heartbeat. Feel the pulse in the umbilical cord where it attaches to the baby’s abdomen. If no pulse can be felt in the cord, you or your helper must listen for the heartbeat.
<li>A heart rate of 100 beats per minute or more is normal</li>
<li>A heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute is slow</li><br>
Minimize the time without ventilation. Listen to the heart rate just long enough to recognize if it is normal or slow.
