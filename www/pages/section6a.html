<p>Improving care saves lives. Knowing the right
care to give is not always enough to save
babies’ lives—that knowledge must be put
into practice.</p>
<p>Completing a workshop in <b>Helping Babies
Breathe</b> is just the first step in improving the
care that you give.</p>
<p>After the course, <b>commit to making a
difference by:</b><br>
<b>(1) Identify areas that need improvement</b>
Identify differences between what is
recommended and what is done at your
facility. Use the Action Plan, the<i> Questions to
improve care and What to monitor.</i>
<br>
<b>(2) Create a system for ongoing practice
and review of cases</b>
Master the <i>Action Plan</i> by participating in
ongoing practice, reviewing your actions every
time you help a baby breathe, and using case
reviews and audits to identify areas that need
improvement.
<br>
<b>(3) Make changes that will improve care</b>
Work with others on a plan to improve care
and take action in your facility.
