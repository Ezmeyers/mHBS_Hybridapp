	<p><b>Evaluate the baby after stimulation by asking the following question: </b><b style="color:#2184e0;">Is the baby breathing well?</b></p>
	<p><b>A baby who is breathing well may be</b><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Crying </li> OR
	<li>Breathing quietly and regularly</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p><b>A baby who is not breathing well may be</b><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Gasping - taking a single deep breath followed by a long pause or several deep, irregular breaths followed by a pause</li>OR
	<li>Not breathing at all</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Some babies will have shallow, irregular, slow, or noisy breathing immediately after birth. Others may have chest indrawing (retractions). These babies with abnormal breathing will require continued monitoring of their breathing, heart rate, and color to decide if they need more help to breathe.</p>
	<p><b>Decide what care the baby needs after clearing the airway and stimulation.</b><br>
	If the baby is breathing well, the baby can receive routine care. Continue to check the breathing. Clamp or tie and cut the umbilical cord. Encourage breastfeeding in the first hour.</p>
	<p><b>If the baby is not breathing well (gasping or not breathing at all), begin ventilation with bag and mask.</b>Quickly move the baby to the area for ventilation. Delaying ventilation may result in death or brain damage.</p>
