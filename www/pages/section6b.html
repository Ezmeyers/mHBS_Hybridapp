<h5 align="left" style="color:#2184e0;">Recording information and
using it to improve care</h5>
<p>
Complete a birth record for every baby
to help plan ongoing care. A simple birth
record also can help identify areas that need
improvement and measure change as a result
of improvement activities.<br>
For example, every baby should receive
<ul>
<li>Thorough drying</li>
<li>Immediate skin-to-skin contact</li>
<li>Delayed cord clamping</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If these actions do not occur, reviewing and
talking with other providers will help you
understand why. Once problems and barriers
are identified, changes can be made to
overcome them.<br>
Review the actions taken if a baby
<ul>
<li>Does not cry at birth</li>
<li>Receives clearing of the airway, stimulation
to breathe, or ventilation with bag and mask</li>
<li>Needs special care after birth</li>
<li>Dies in the delivery area</li>
<li>Is stillborn</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The care may be appropriate and complete,
or there may be steps in care that can be
improved. When improvement activities
are in progress, the birth record can help
measure change.</p>
