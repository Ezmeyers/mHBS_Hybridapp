      <p><b>Helping Babies Breathe</b> teaches birth attendants how to care for newborns at birth.</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>All babies need to be kept clean, warm, and helped to breastfeed</li>
	  <li>Babies who do not breathe need extra help in the first minute after birth</li>
	  </ul>
      <p><b>Helping Babies Breathe</b> focuses on The Golden Minute when stimulation to breathe and ventilation with bag and mask can save a life. At least one person skilled in helping a baby breathe should be present at every birth.</p>
	  <p><b>Helping Babies Breathe</b> is designed to be
		part of a program for essential newborn care,
		which covers important actions in the first
		days after birth. However, training is only a
		first step toward the goal of better health for
		newborns.</p>

		the community. The provider helps the
		pregnant woman and her family prepare
		a birth plan and emergency plan during
		antenatal care. Health workers, community
		leaders, and families support women to
		have a skilled attendant at birth. Health
		facilities maintain enough skilled people
		and equipment and the providers work as a
		team to give the best care.</p>
      <p>With planning and work to put into practice the skills of <b>Helping Babies Breathe</b>, you can make sure every baby has a chance to breathe at birth.</p>
