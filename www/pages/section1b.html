	  <p><b>Wash hands</b><br>
	  Handwashing helps prevent the spread of infection. Wash hands with soap and clean water or use an alcohol-based cleaner before and after caring for a mother or a baby (see page 52). Be sure that everyone at the birth washes their hands. Gloves also protect from infections carried by blood and body fluids.</p>
	  <p><b>Prepare anarea for ventilation</b><br>
	  Prepare a warm, dry, flat, and safe space for the baby to receive ventilation if needed. Prepare a safe delivery kit, uterotonic (such as oxytocin or misoprostol), and equipment to help a baby breathe. Equipment should be disinfected after use and kept clean. Check that all equipment and supplies are ready for use in the area for ventilation. Test the function of the ventilation bag, mask, and suction device (see page 47).</p>
